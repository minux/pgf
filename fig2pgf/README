fig2pgf converts a xfig image into pgf code (currently pgf 0.65) or
TikZ code (pgf 0.95).

Usage: fig2pgf [--pgf|--tikz] file1.fig file2.pgf

The default format ist tikz as it is more user friendly.

Notice: The backends are currently quite limited, only lines
(polygons, boxes etc.) and text are supported. Parsing is complete,
so missing features can be implemented in PGFWriter.cpp and TikZWriter.cpp.
